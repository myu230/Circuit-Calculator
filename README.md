Circuit calculator which prompts the user to select a type of electronic circuit from categories shown below,
user can then enter data values and the program will calculate remaining parameters.

Amplifiers Calculator

Program will calculate gain and output voltage of diffferent amplifiers.
A negative gain / voltage represents inversion.

A. Inverting Amplifiers
B. Non-inverting Amplifiers
C. Summing Amplifiers

High Pass Filters

1. RC High Pass Filter
2. RL High Pass Filter

Low Pass Filters

1. RC Low Pass Filter
2. RL Low Pass Filter

Band-Pass Filter
A band-pass filter can be made by placing a low pass filter after a high pass filter.
The fc of the low pass filter must be higher than the fc of the high pass filter.

Band-Stop Filter
A band-stop filter can be made by placing a high pass filter after a low pass filter.
The fc of the high pass filter must be higher than the fc of the low pass filter.

Resonance Circuit Calculator

All circuits calculated as ideal resonance.

A. Series Resonance
B. Parallel Resonance
